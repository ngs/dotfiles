This script uses a simple eruby template to create a new TextMate project file. It is opinionated in that it's set up for my preferred working environment on Linux/Mac OS X.

Requirements

ruby :-)
erubis
~/Documents/projects directory

Installation

$ rake install

This creates ~/bin and ~/lib, and copies the script and template, respectively.

Usage

ARGV[0] is the name of the directory where the project is located.
ARGV[1] can be anything, and is whether the project file should be created in the PWD, or in the projects directory.

$ cd ~/code
$ tmproj rails_app y

This will create ~/code/rails_app.tmproj. Simply open the file up in TextMate!
