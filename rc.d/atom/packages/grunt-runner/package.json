You\n can toggle it with `ctrl-alt-t`.\n * If your task doesn't end automatically (e.g. watches files for changes) you\n can force it stop from the menu or by pressing `ctrl-alt-shift-g`.\n\nSome [issues still exist](#known-issues).\n\n## Installation\n\n#### For Use\nInstall Grunt Runner package using the command line\n\n    apm install grunt-runner\n\nOr install it from the Atom Package Manager.\n\n#### For Development\nIf you want to make changes to this project. Install the package using\n\n    apm develop grunt-runner\n\nThen open Atom in developer mode (Atom command tools must be installed)\n\n    cd path/to/package\n    atom --dev\n\n## Known issues\n\n * Grunt Runner currently only supports one open project at a time. If\n multiple projects with Gruntfiles are open then running a task from\n `Packages->Grunt->` menu will have unexpected results.\n\n * Tasks added to a Gruntfile will not be reflected in the menu until\n the package reloads, this can forced by reopening your project or\n pressing `ctlr-alt-cmd-L`.\n\n * `.coffee` files are not currently supported.\n",
